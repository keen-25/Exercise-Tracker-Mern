A project I started as a means of educating myself, fine-tuning my skills, and practicing/doing in conjunction with the datamine course through 'The Purdue Data Mine'. I followed along with a YouTube video as a means of learning, and I plan to update these files to make the website look and feel the way that I want. Started this process in February of 2025, hit a wall/started working, so I'm finishing it now during winter break before going back for my master's program in January. As of February, the website wasn't visually appealing and was very barebones. I used an AI agent/vibe coding to smooth out any potential errors and create a start-all command. Would like to make the website a bit more intuitive.
